# Deno Codespace Template ðŸ¦•

A simple template to fast track testing Deno using Github Codespaces.


## Getting Started

The following command will start a basic http server that's included in this repo:

```sh
# deno run --allow-net --allow-env --watch --unstable mod.ts
```

If everything worked it should output a URL to access the http server running inside your new Codespace.
